I received my diploma from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Democritus University of 
Thrace, Greece in 2017, and I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree entitled 
"Data Science for Environmental Applications" at the same institution estimated to be completed in Q3 2022.
During my Ph.D. time, I am a Teaching Assistant (Databases, Data Mining, Machine Learning) and a Research Associate. I have published [10 scientific 
papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eDbjFQMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) being cited more that 200 times.


In 2019-2020 I fulfilled my military service, while in that year I landed my first Data Science job in a 
Quantitative and Algorithmic Trading Research company where I am currently working.

I love data. I am passionate about Data Science. I learn every day in this exciting, ever changing field.
As I learn, I try to write blog posts to document my journey on [Medium](https://medium.com/@dimitris.effrosynidis) 
and my personal (website)[https://deffro.github.io/]. The code for most of my projects is available on (GitHub)[https://github.com/Deffro], where 
my (Data Science Portfolio)[https://github.com/Deffro/Data-Science-Portfolio] is also located.

At the beginning of my Data Science journey, I was competing in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/deffro). 
Because, how can you learn if you don't get your hands dirty?

I am experienced with Python and specialize in Data Cleaning, Analysis, Visualization and Machine Learning.

You can contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimitrios-effrosynidis/).

On my free time I play board games, paint miniatures, create dioramas, watch tv shows and movies, play computer games and the piano. I also travel as much as possible.
