I received my diploma from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Democtirus University of Thrace, Greece in 2017, and I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree entitled "Data Science for Environmental Applications" at the same institution estimated to be completed in Q1 2021.

I love data. I am passionate about Data Science.

While being a Teaching Assistant and a Research Associate by doing research for my Ph.D. and publishing scientific [papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eDbjFQMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao),
at the same time I am competing on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/deffro) and work on Data Science [projects](https://deffro.github.io/projects/).

I am experienced with Python and specialize in Data Cleaning, Analysis, Visualization and Machine Learning.

If you are interested you can contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimitrios-effrosynidis/).

On my free time I play board games, paint miniatures, create dioramas, watch tv shows and movies, play computer games and the piano. I also travel as much as possible.
