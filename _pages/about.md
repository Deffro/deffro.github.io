I received my diploma from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Democtirus University of Thrace, Greece in 2017, and I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree entitled "Data Science for Environmental Applications" at the same institution estimated to be completed in Q1 2021.

I love data. I am passionate about Data Science.

While being a Teaching Assistant and a Research Associate by doing research for my Ph.D. and publishing scientific papers, at the same time I am competing on Kaggle and work on Data Science projects.

I am experienced with Python and specialize in Data Cleaning, Analysis, Visualization and Machine Learning.
