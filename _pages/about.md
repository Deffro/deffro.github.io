I received my diploma from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Democritus University of 
Thrace, Greece in 2017, and right after, I started pursuing a Ph.D. degree entitled 
"Data Science for Environmental Applications". I successfullt defended my Ph.D. on 2022.
During my Ph.D. time, I was a Teaching Assistant (Databases, Data Mining, Machine Learning).
On top of that I was working as a Research Associate, where I am still working for more than 5 years. I have published [13 scientific 
papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eDbjFQMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) being cited more that 360 times.


In 2019-2020 I fulfilled my military service, while in that year I landed my first Data Science job in a 
Quantitative and Algorithmic Trading Research company.
During my time there, I have contributed significantly to my company's success by implementing Machine Learning from scratch, 
building Data Science Pipelines, and developing and evaluating Machine Learning models. 

One of my key achievements was introducing Machine Learning to the company. I built everything from scratch, including algorithms, models, and tools. 
This significantly improved the company's ability to analyze data and make informed decisions.
I also developed Data Science Pipelines that automated various procedures, including Data Aggregation, Pre-processing, Feature Engineering and Selection, 
Model Training and Evaluation, Analysis, and Simulation. These pipelines have saved hours of manual work for the team, allowing them to focus on other critical tasks.

My analytical skills were further evidenced by my ability to analyze data using Interactive Visualizations. I developed tools that were used daily by the team, 
and these tools helped to explain complex data in an easy-to-understand manner.
I also developed and evaluated various Machine Learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Light Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and K-means. 
I was explaining the outcomes of Classification and Regression Machine Learning models, as well as the interactions between predictors and targets.
My experience and expertise have allowed me eventually to supervise and mentor other Data Scientists, demonstrating my ability to collaborate and communicate effectively with colleagues.

My journey in the company lasted 2 years and 7 months. After this period, I successfully landed my second Data Science job in 2022, where I am still working.


I love data. I am passionate about Data Science. I learn every day in this exciting, ever changing field.
As I learn, I try to write blog posts to document my journey on [Medium](https://medium.com/@dimitris.effrosynidis) 
and my personal [website](https://deffro.github.io/). The code for most of my projects is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Deffro), where 
my [Data Science Portfolio](https://github.com/Deffro/Data-Science-Portfolio) is also located.

At the beginning of my Data Science journey, I was competing in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/deffro). 
Because, how can you learn if you don't get your hands dirty?

I am experienced with Python and specialize in Data Processing, Analysis, Visualization and Machine Learning.

You can contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimitrios-effrosynidis/).

On my free time I read, play board games, paint miniatures, create dioramas, watch tv shows and movies, play computer games and the piano. I also travel as much as possible.
