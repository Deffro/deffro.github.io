This article focuses on the sentiment analysis of product reviews from the Flipkart Customer Review dataset.

Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. It enables businesses to gain insights from customer feedback.

Our objective is to explore and compare multiple methods for binary sentiment classification, evaluating their performance and computational efficiency.

The methods range from traditional approaches to advanced techniques leveraging embeddings and generative models.

Some methods require labeled data and some do not at all.
