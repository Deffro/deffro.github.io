Generative AI transforms industries by enabling machines to produce human-like text, generate structured outputs, and solve complex problems creatively.

However, the magic happens when you combine cutting-edge models with advanced techniques like prompt engineering, quantized model optimization, and grammar-constrained sampling.

In this project, I explore the forefront of these techniques, demonstrating how to harness the capabilities of state-of-the-art language models to achieve specific and efficient results.

From crafting intricate prompts to controlling the randomness and structure of outputs, this work reflects the fusion of creativity, technical expertise, and a deep understanding of model behavior.
