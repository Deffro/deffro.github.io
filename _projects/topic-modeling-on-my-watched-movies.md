**The project is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Deffro/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Notebooks/Topic%20Modelling%20on%20my%20Watched%20Movies) and online on [Medium](https://medium.com/@dimitris.effrosynidis/topic-modeling-on-my-watched-movies-1d17491803b4)**

I rate all the movies I watch on IMDb and the website allows you to download a nice .csv with all your ratings. This .csv contains basic information about the movies. In order to perform topic modeling, I need the plots and/or summaries of the movies. I will grab this information from Wikipedia and use it to enrich the IMDb dataset. Then I will perform LDA for topic modeling on the plots+summaries of the movies to find 6 topics.
The purpose of this project is to:
- Use Wikipedia to grab movies and more specifically their Summaries and Plots.
- Merge IMDb data with Wikipedia.
- Build, Evaluate and Visualize an LDA model
